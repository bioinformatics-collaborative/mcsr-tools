# This .Rprofile is used to get a more specific local library
# path (.libPaths()) for even minor versions of R.  The local library
# path is where bioconductor/cran/github packages are stored in each
# users home directory.
#
# Keeping the local libraries seperate for each minor version of R 
# on the MCSR will keep pipelines from breaking because of dependency
# issues as well as others (see below).
