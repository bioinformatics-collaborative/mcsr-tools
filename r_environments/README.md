# R Environments
A repository for various custom environment files for different use cases on the MCSR.

## Information and Resources
.Rprofiles act as a startup script, whenever you load the R shell.  .Renvirons
act as a place to hold environment variables.  They are similar to the .bashrc
and .bash_profile scripts also in your home directory, but they are written in R.

Helpful information about these files can be found below.  They also contain
 helpful information about .Rprofile.d and .Renvirons.d directories.
